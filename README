/usr/port/mystuff

This is my local collection of ports for my OpenBSD systems.  Patches
welcome that fix bugs, upgrade ports, and so on.

The tree is kept on github:
    https://github.com/dcantrell/mystuff

I also post built packages as well as gzipped tar files of the port
source here:
    http://www.burdell.org/openbsd/mystuff

Packaging policies I'm trying to follow:
1) Ports should be compatible with the latest stable release of OpenBSD.
2) Python ports should favor the preferred Python package as installed
   with the latest stable release's ports collection (e.g., in the case
   of OpenBSD 4.8, this is Python 2.5).
3) Whenever possible, use the ports provided by the official ports tree.
4) Basic porting policies stated in the porter's guide (e.g., no files
   in /usr/local/etc).
5) Docs are installed to /usr/local/share/doc/PORTNAME
6) Python module ports are named py-NAME even if the upstream name is
   pyNAME or python-NAME.  This is for consistency with the official
   ports tree which uses the py-* naming convention.
7) Python ports that include a module and some end user programs do not
   follow the #6 convention.
8) Replace #!/usr/bin/python with '#!/usr/bin/env python' since there is
   not /usr/bin/python on an OpenBSD system.
