/usr/ports/mystuff

This is my local collection of ports for my OpenBSD systems.  Patches
welcome that fix bugs, upgrade ports, and so on.

The tree is kept on github:
    https://github.com/dcantrell/mystuff

I also post built packages as well as gzipped tar files of the port
source here:
    http://www.burdell.org/openbsd/mystuff

Policies I'm trying to follow:
------------------------------

1) Ports should be compatible with the latest stable release of OpenBSD.
2) Python ports should favor the preferred Python package as installed
   with the latest stable release's ports collection (e.g., in the case
   of OpenBSD 4.8, this is Python 2.5).
3) Whenever possible, use the ports provided by the official ports tree.
4) Basic porting policies stated in the porter's guide (e.g., no files
   in /usr/local/etc).
5) Docs are installed to /usr/local/share/doc/PORTNAME
6) Python module ports are named py-NAME even if the upstream name is
   pyNAME or python-NAME.  This is for consistency with the official
   ports tree which uses the py-* naming convention.
7) Python ports that include a module and some end user programs do not
   follow the #6 convention.
8) Replace #!/usr/bin/python with '#!/usr/bin/env python' since there is
   no /usr/bin/python on an OpenBSD system.
9) When I update a port but the version remains the same, I increment
   the REVISION number.  I leave old builds on the download site (for no
   particular reason other than for historical purposes).

Branches:
---------

The master branch is intended for the latest stable release of OpenBSD.
I do not follow -current on any of my systems, so my ports are built to
work with the latest stable release.  That means my ports may lag behind
the official releases a bit as I take some time to clean them up when a
new release comes out.

When a new stable release is made, I take that opportunity to go through
and update any ports that have newer versions, remove any that are now
part of the official tree, and make other changes.  Throughout the 6
month period a stable release is out, I usually just do bug fixes to my
ports.

Ports for previous OpenBSD releases are on their own branch in my git
repository.  The branch names match the CVS branch names that OpenBSD
uses.  If you want ports for, say, OpenBSD 4.8, checkout the OPENBSD_4_8
branch of this project.  Once a new release is made, I will create a
new branch from master to match the previous release.

I may change things one day to have master follow -current and branch at
the same time as OpenBSD does, but really it's just me and the software
I use on my own systems.
