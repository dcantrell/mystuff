The argparse module provides an easy, declarative interface for creating
command line tools, which knows how to:

* parse the arguments and flags from sys.argv
* convert arg strings into objects for your program
* format and print informative help messages
* and much more...

The argparse module improves on the standard library optparse module in
a number of ways including:

* handling positional arguments
* supporting sub-commands
* allowing alternative option prefixes like + and /
* handling zero-or-more and one-or-more style arguments
* producing more informative usage messages
* providing a much simpler interface for custom types and actions
