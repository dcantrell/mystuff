A Python library used to interact with Git repositories.

The module provides a object model access to your git repository.  Once
you have created a repository object, you can traverse it to find parent
commit(s), trees, blobs, etc.

This module is a port of the grit library in Ruby created by Tom
Preston-Werner and Chris Wanstrath.
